# Movement (Gyrotonic & Gyrokinesis methods) and Mindfulness
!["What is to give light must endure burning."  -Viktor Frankl](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fa7ac407-fbf0-45a4-b1f6-9226ae16b42c.jpg)

Helgi teaches the Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis movement methods, as well as integrative mindfulness techniques. 

Each of these methods, separately or in combination, are ideal for busy humans who want to explore the art of living fully. To increase the sense of vitality at the level of the body, mind or both. To activate the capacity to create a bright future full of wellbeing.

She teaches at LVL 42 in Toronto, near the corner of King & Yonge. 

To schedule a session email: helgi.maki@gmail.com

Helgi is a certified Gyrotonic instructor, and a Gyrokinesis apprentice in training. She will seek her Gyrokinesis instructor certification in late 2016/early 2017\. And she is a certified teacher of Sophrology, an integrative approach to mindfulness that uses a toolbox of meditation techniques to create an everyday experience of peaceful vitality.
